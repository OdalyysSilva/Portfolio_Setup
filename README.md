# 💻 Portfolio 3D – Programmer Mini Setup Project

This project is a personal 3D portfolio featuring a **custom Blender-made programmer setup**, fully integrated into a web environment using **WebGL**.  
The main goal is to combine **3D modeling**, **front-end development**, and **modern portfolio design** into a single interactive experience.

## 🎮 Project Overview

I created a small 3D scene that represents my personal programmer setup.  
The model includes several elements that reflect a real workstation:

- Desk  
- Monitor  
- Keyboard  
- Mouse  
- PC case  
- Extra creative object (custom)  

Everything was modeled from scratch in **Blender** and later exported as a **GLB file** to be used on the web.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Blender** — For modeling the complete 3D scene  
- **GLB/GLTF** — Export format for WebGL  
- **Three.js or `<model-viewer>`** — For rendering the model in the browser  
- **HTML + CSS** — For page design  
- **JavaScript** — For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior  
- **GitHub Pages** — For hosting the final result online  
- **GitHub** — Version control and public repository  

## 🌐 WebGL Integration

The 3D model is displayed directly in the browser, allowing users to:

- Rotate  
- Zoom  
- Inspect the setup  
- Interact with added JavaScript features  

## 🚀 Features

- Fully original 3D programmer setup  
- Interactive 3D viewer  
- Web-based presentation  
- Portfolio-style design  
- Clean and modern aesthetic  
- Public hosting through GitHub Pages  

## 📂 Project Files

The repository includes:

- Blender source file (`.blend`)  
- Exported model (`.glb`)  
- Web files (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- Assets folder 

## 🔧 Project Purpose

This work serves as:

- A school assignment  
- A personal introduction to 3D web integration  
- A portfolio piece to demonstrate creativity, modeling, and development skills
